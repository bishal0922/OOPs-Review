# Guide to Object Oriented Programming

## What is Object Oriented Programming?

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design and program applications. The main idea of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

## Why OOP?

OOP is a very popular programming paradigm. It is used to design large and complex applications. It is also used to design small and simple applications. The main reason for using OOP is to make the code more modular and reusable. It is also used to make the code easier to maintain and debug.

## What is a Class?

A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). The user-defined objects are created using the class keyword. The class is a collection of objects. It is a logical entity that has some specific attributes and methods (functions) associated with it. For example: if you have an animal class, it would contain all the common properties that animals have (fur, legs, tail, etc.) and all the common methods (eat, sleep, walk, etc.).

## What is an Object?

An object is a basic unit of Object Oriented Programming and represents the real-life entities. A typical object contains three characteristics:

* State: It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
